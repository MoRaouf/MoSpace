<br>Welcome to my Space of Data!<br>
Here you will find everything data-related where I will be sharing my projects and experiences.<br>
I believe in interdisciplinary collaboration and open science.<br>
Therefore, I try to contribute to the open world of data by publishing my knowledge through this blog.<br>
<br>
Oh! One moment . . .<br>
In a nutshell, I'm Mohammed Raouf, & I'm a Data Scientist & Machine Learning Enthusiast<br>

                  <h4>The cosmos is infinite, the brain is limitless & the science is unbounded.<br>So, lets aspire to reach the unreachable.</h4>
                  <p>I have always been fascinated by anything that positively impacts people's lives, this have directed me to acquire a BSc 
                      in Mechatronics & Industrial Robotics as I have seen some great technologies like autonomous cars & embedded systems 
                      are adding a great value to the community. Meanwhile, the unprecedented impact that Machine Learning has shwon accross all disciplines has 
                      stimulated me to shift to this field & embark on a journey of exploration into this deep multidsiplinary spectrum.<br> 
                      
                      And as I always wanted to be an astronaut where I can explore the infinite universe, Machine Learning has made this possible 
                      & more of a reality with all its potentials & capabilities where anyone can explore the whole world through the lenses of the 
                      massive amounts of available data. With my ongoing MSc in Data Science, I'm hoping the journey unfolds huge successes & contributions 
                      to the field & positive influence to people & their lives.</p>
