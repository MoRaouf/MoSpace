Ever since the "Age of AI" series was streamed on youtube for the great actor Robert Downey Junior, & the breakthrough of DeepMind's "AlphaGo" beating #1 global Go player, I fell in love with AI & its applications. As I saw that AI & ML have endless capabilites that allow us to turn our imaginations into realities, I decided to step into the Data Science field. 

Now as I'm pursuing my MSc in Data Science at Heriot-Watt University in Dubai, I'm opening my imagination to the fullest as I'm continuously learning how to adapt the algorithms I learn to our life needs & to business cases where it serves the best. Besides, when I started to tap into Neural Networks & experience their outstanding artificial simulation to the human brain functionalities, I get more & more tempted to dive deep & learn the core concepts behind the so much powerful Deep Learning algorithms.

Having a BSc in Mechatronics & Industrial Robotics, the background initiated the interest in the high-level applications of AI. As I studied a bit about Embedded Systems & their applications in autonomous cars, studying DL algorithms such as Computer Vision & Natural Language Processing sparked me to continue the learning journey to explore the hidden capabilities of these artificial technologies & to make somthing big out of it.

And as I'm always thinking of human-related services where technology should serve the human being, I aspire to create beneficial services out of AI algorithms that add value to our lives.
For Now, my current interest is in NLP applications in Tourism, & I'm in the progress of creating a tourism-related service that builds on top of NLP.

In my spare time, I like to workout & do some sports. My greatest passion is to travel accross the world & explore different cultures & lifestyles, so a good share of my spare time is & will be invested in travelling.
