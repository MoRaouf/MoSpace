# A blog is born

These days, there are countless blogging alternatives covering an
extremely wide range of needs, from writing everything in `.docx` format to
customizing every minor nit with CSS and HTML. It is not difficult to get lost
in this sea of blogging alternatives and end up being unable to choose one of
the alternatives and set the blog up. Even though I already experimented with
[a blog]() during my Google Summer of Code internship and I have now started
this new blog, I am far from an expert in blogging platforms.

I cannot write a complete guide for prospective bloggers, however, I still feel like
writing about how I created and configured this blog can be useful to plenty
of people who considers creating a blog somewhat similar to this one. As you
may have guessed already, I highly value understanding what I do and being
able to modify (or at least see) its inner workings.

The first section is an overview of the technologies and libraries used in this blog.
Afterwards there are 3 base sections: writing the content, building the blog
and hosting it. These cover the base elements needed to get the blog running.
Eventually, there is 2 extra sections on more advanced configuration and on
the features I value the most.

## Overview
The content for this blog is written using either jupyter notebooks, markdown
or docx files. Posts are then converted thanks to
[fastpages](https://fastpages.fast.ai/) to markdown and html files that
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) can use to build the static website. Every
time a new commit is pushed to GitHub,
[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) are used to
automatically build the website and push it to the `gh-pages` branch. The
website stored in the `gh-pages` branch is then hosted by
[GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/). Here is the diagram of the workflow
from the fastpages website:

## Writing content
Writing the content using Markdown is one of the most common alternatives for
writing blog posts. Writing in Markdown has many advantages and produces files
which are readable both rendered and without rendering. To write code tutorials
however, they are not too convenient as we need to manually execute each
cell and add the output of the code to the post.

If we use Jupyter notebooks instead, we can keep the code, its output and the
explanations in the same _executable_ file. This is really convenient as I can
easily rerun the notebooks whenever there has been a significant change in the
libraries used and keep the tutorials up to date. The main drawback of writing
posts in Jupyter notebooks is having to convert the notebooks to markdown or
html so the post can be added to the blog. I am taking advantage of
fastpages to both take care of the conversion and to automate the process.

Eventually, I only have to write my posts in either markdown or Jupyter
notebook files and push them to GitHub. This is crucial to me as it
makes creating new posts be only about writing! I don't have to take care
about conversion.

## Building the blog
This blog is built using Jekyll, an open source static website generator.
Roughly speaking, it takes a configuration file with information such as the
theme or the markdown parser to be used, and the website content as markdown
and html files. And generates a static website where the theme has been filled
with the content, pages and blog posts.

fastpages uses the default jekyll theme: [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima).
Even though it works perfectly and has many features, I wanted to use a
different theme, to give another look to the website and make it more
attractive to readers. I tried changing the theme specified the configuration
file passed to Jekyll for several themes I found more visually attractive and
found [basically basic](https://mmistakes.github.io/jekyll-theme-basically-basic/)
(see screenshots below) and
[massively](https://iwiedenm.github.io/jekyll-theme-massively/) to work
quite well out of the box. Most of the themes did not work at all due to
incompatibilities with fastpages. After comparing both themes for a while, I
decided to go with massively. I therefore tweaked the theme to fix the minor
incompatibilities it presented with fastpages.

<div class="box alt">
<div class="row 50% uniform">
  <div class="6u"><span class="image fit"><img src="{{ "images/posts/bb_home.png" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span></div>
  <div class="6u$"><span class="image fit"><img src="{{ "images/posts/bb_posts.png" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span></div>
</div>
</div>

Some of the tweaks will be detailed in the last two sections of the post, but
many will not be covered here. If you are interested in any of the two themes
and their compatibility with fastpages please reach out in an
[issue](https://github.com/OriolAbril/oriol_unraveled/issues).

## Hosting a static website
As explained in the overview, this website is hosted by GitHub pages. Even
though this was initially the one that seemed more difficult to me, I actually
found this step simpler than the other two. Basically GitHub Pages takes care
of everything.

The main friction I encountered while using GitHub pages was the `.nojekyll`
file. There are two main ways of interacting with GitHub pages. The first
alternative is to push to `gh-pages` a directory containing a `_config.yml`
file with the Jekyll configuration and the content in Markdown and HTML
format. GitHup then builds the site for you using Jekyll. The second
alternative is to build the site and push the result to `gh-pages` branch
together with a `.nojekyll` file. The `.nojekyll` file tells GitHub to not
build the site with Jekyll and host directly the contents of the branch
instead.

In this particular case, we are using fastpages via GitHub Actions to convert
the posts and build the site using Jekyll, so we are actually using the second
alternative. Luckily, thanks to fastpages, these two alternatives do not affect
the writing process at all.

## The best of many worlds
So far we have described how to create and maintain a plain blog, the main
difference with forking the minima theme and writing a blog with markdown is
the ability to write posts in Jupyter notebooks. I would like this blog to be
more than that. This blog combines features from fastpages, massively and
basically basic aiming to add the most relevants to my use case in this blog.

The blog is mobile friendly thanks to the massively theme plus some extra
tweaks from Basically Basic theme. I also borrowed the text size scaling from
Basically Basic, now whatever the screen size, the text should always be
readable.

I customized the favicon too. As you can see, it is neither the one of
fastpages nor of massively theme. It is a custom image of a matlab style
waterfall plot of a 2d non-local prior. This was actually simpler than I
expected, there are converters online to generate favicons from regular
images, and then saving the favicon as `images/favicon.ico` is enough for
everything to work.

fastpages also has support for google analytics and seo tag management. For
now, I decided to use google analytics but remove the seo related code. I may
add it again at some point but not before I understand how it works.

#### Notebook shields
Many of my posts will be tutorials written as Jupyter notebooks. Being able to
include the content from ipynb files to the blog is awesome, but why stop
here? fastpages allows to add 3 shields to notebook posts so that the notebook
can be opened in GitHub, Google Colab or [Binder](https://mybinder.org/).

<div class="nb-badges" style="display: flex; justify-content: flex-start">
  <div class="px-2"><img class="notebook-badge-image" src="{{ "assets/badges/github.svg" | relative_url }}" alt="Open In GitHub"/></div>
  <div class="px-2"><img class="notebook-badge-image" src="{{ "assets/badges/binder.svg" | relative_url }}" alt="Open In Binder"/></div>
  <div class="px-2"><img class="notebook-badge-image" src="{{ "assets/badges/colab.svg" | relative_url }}" alt="Open In Colab"/></div>
</div>

Binder generates a container where the notebook can be executed interactively
without requiring any local installation. This allows readers to run the code
included in the tutorial while they read it with little to no effort, just
click on the binder shield. Binder cannot work straight out of the box
however, to create the container it needs to know what should be installed. I
have used an `environment.yml` to install the required Python libraries with
Conda and a `JuliaProject.toml` for the Julia libraries. Guidance on
specifying requirements for Binder can be found in its
[docs](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using.html)

#### Tag Archive
The tag archive, similarly to the index of a reference book can be an
invaluable help to readers in navigating the website and finding posts
relevant to their interests. fastpages already includes a tag archive page
unlike the massively theme, however, I think its single list formatting does
not scale well with the number of posts and different tags. The table format
from Basically Basic was much more attractive to me, so I combined the tag
archive page from BB theme with the square layout of massively. I also removed
the post image to get a more compact look.

#### Social Media links
Thanks to [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/) I have been able to add links
to GitHub and Twitter profiles and to the blog's Atom feed: <a href="{{ site.feed.path | default: 'feed.xml' | relative_url }}" title="Atom Feed" class="icon fa-rss">
<span class="label">{{ site.data.theme.t.subscribe | default: 'Subscribe' }}</span></a>
in the navigation bar. Moreover, there is also a link to the search page.

All these social media links are also in the copyright notice found in the
website footer, where thanks to [academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/),
the links to my ORCID and Google Scholar profiles are also available.
